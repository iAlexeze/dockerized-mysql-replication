# Source-Replica Data Replication with Docker Compose

This repository provides a setup for source-replica data replication between two different servers using Docker Compose. It simplifies the process of setting up MySQL replication, allowing for efficient data synchronization between a source and multiple replica servers.

## Prerequisites

- 2 or more servers (depending on your use case)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Basic knowledge of Linux and Docker Compose

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository on both the source and replica servers:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iAlexeze/dockerized-mysql-replication.git
```

### 2. Setting Up the Source Server

Navigate to the `source` directory on the source server:

```bash
cd dockerized-mysql-replication/source
```

#### 2.1 Modify `compose.yml`

- Uncomment the volume mount to create a backup of the database, which can be stored externally (e.g., in an AWS S3 bucket). This step is optional:

  ```yaml
  # Map a directory to backup data.
  # - /mnt/data-backup:/var/lib/mysql
  ```

- Ensure that port `4440` is available and open on the server to avoid conflicts. You can change the port if you want.

#### 2.2 Modify `source.env`

Update the environment variables with your choice of user and a secure password:

```env
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my_secure_root_password
MYSQL_USER=my_default_user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=my_secure_default_password
```

#### 2.3 Modify `mysql.conf.cnf`

Specify the databases you want to replicate:

```cnf
binlog_do_db = demo_1
binlog_do_db = demo_2
binlog_do_db = demo_3
```

#### 2.4 Modify `setup_replication.sh`

Update the following variables:

```bash
SOURCE="source-database"  # Container name for the source database
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="my_secure_root_password"
REPLICATION_USER="my_replication_user"
REPLICATION_PASSWORD="my_secure_replication_password"
DATABASES=("demo_1" "demo_2" "demo_3")
```

(Optional)

To enable future connections to source without using root user, set the following variables -  important for debugging, and 3rd party connections.

```bash
DEFAULT_USER="my_default_user"
DEFAULT_PASSWORD="my_secure_default_password"
```

#### 2.5 Run the Setup Script

Execute the setup script:

```bash
./setup_replication.sh
```

This script will set up the source database server, create the listed databases, and output the necessary information for setting up the replica:

```
Source Host: source_ip_address
Source Port: source_port
Replication User: replication_user
Replication Password: replication_password
Current Log: 1.xxxxx
Current Position: 2xxx
```

If successful, you'll see the above snippet with the `Log` and `Position` and other useful information. Copy this output as it will be needed for the replica setup.

### 3. Setting Up the Replica Server

Navigate to the `replica` directory on the replica server:

```bash
cd dockerized-mysql-replication/replica
```

#### 3.1 Modify `setup_replication.sh`

Update the following variables using the outputs from the source server's setup script:

```bash
SOURCE_HOST="source_ip_address"
SOURCE_PORT=source_port
REPLICATION_USER="replication_user"
REPLICATION_PASSWORD="replication_password"
CURRENT_LOG="1.xxxxx"
CURRENT_POS="2xxx"
```

These values are crucial for connecting the replica to the source. Also, update the following variables:

```bash
REPLICA="replica-database"  # Container name for the replica database
SOURCE_HOST="source_ip_address"
SOURCE_PORT=4440  # DO NOT PUT THIS IN QUOTES
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="my_secure_root_password"
REPLICATION_USER="my_replication_user"
REPLICATION_PASSWORD="my_secure_replication_password"
DATABASES=("demo_1" "demo_2" "demo_3")
```

(Optional)

To enable future connections to replica without using root user -  important for debugging, and 3rd party connections.

```bash
DEFAULT_USER="my_default_user"
DEFAULT_PASSWORD="my_secure_default_password"
```

#### 3.2 Modify `compose.yml`

- Ensure that port `4441` is available and open on the server to avoid conflicts. You can change the port if you want.

#### 3.3 Modify `replica.env`

Update the environment variables with your choice of user and a secure password:

```env
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my_secure_root_password
MYSQL_USER=my_replication_user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=my_secure_replication_user_password
```

#### 3.4 Modify `mysql.conf.cnf`

Specify the databases you want to replicate:

```cnf
binlog_do_db = demo_1
binlog_do_db = demo_2
binlog_do_db = demo_3
```

### 4. Setting Up Additional Replicas

To set up additional replicas, follow the same process as above but change the `server-id` to a unique value for each replica:

- Source: `server-id = 1`
- Replica I: `server-id = 2`
- Replica II: `server-id = 3`
- Replica III: `server-id = 4`

All other configurations remain the same.

### 5. Run the Setup Script on the Replica Server

Execute the setup script:

```bash
./setup_replication.sh
```
### 6. Testing the Replication

After setting up the source and replica servers, itâ€™s crucial to test the replication to ensure that data is properly synchronized.

#### On the Source Server

1. **Login to the Source Database Container:**

   Use the following command to log in to the source database container and access the `demo_1` database:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it source-database bash -c "mysql -u my_default_user -p demo_1"
   ```

   - You will be prompted to enter the password:
   - Enter the password: `my_secure_default_password`

2. **Create a Table:**

   Once you are in the MySQL environment, run the following command to create a table in the `demo_1` database:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE demo_table (id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL);
   ```

   - Insert a record into the table:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO demo_table (name) VALUES ('Test Record');
   ```

#### On the Replica Server

1. **Login to the Replica Database Container:**

   Use the following command to log in to the replica database container and access the same `demo_1` database:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it replica-database bash -c "mysql -u my_default_user -p demo_1"
   ```

   - You will be prompted to enter the password:
   - Enter the password: `my_secure_default_password`

2. **Show the Created Table:**

   Once you are in the MySQL environment, run the following command to display the tables in the `demo_1` database:

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES;
   ```

   - You should see `demo_table` listed.

3. **Verify the Data:**

   To verify that the data has been replicated, run the following command:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM demo_table;
   ```

   - You should see the record (`'Test Record'`) that was inserted in the source database.

4. **Confirm Replication:**

   To further confirm replication, you can drop the table in the source database and check again on the replica:

   **On the Source Server:**

   ```sql
   DROP TABLE demo_table;
   ```

   **On the Replica Server:**

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES;
   ```

   - The `demo_table` should no longer exist, indicating that the drop action was replicated successfully.

### 1. Clean Up

Run the following commands on both the source and replica servers to clean up.

On source server

```bash
docker compose down source-database
```

On replica server:

```bash
docker compose down replica-database
```
